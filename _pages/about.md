I have a broad interest in data analytics and bioinformatics applications in evolutionary genomics and One Health. During my graduate studies, I concentrated on the population and evolutionary genetics of plants, indigenous livestock, and endangered wildlife. My research focused on understanding the genetic basis of population diversity, demographic history, and the effects of genetic drift and gene flow on evolution. Overtime, I've developed expertise in other omics approaches such as transcriptomics and metagenomics.
I am also passionate about projects and programs, how to make them run efficiently and effectively achieving their goals and objectives in the end.

# Academic work and research

As a bioinformatician and specialist in evolutionary and population genetics, I hold a Ph.D. in Biotechnology from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology in Kenya. My research interests lie at the intersection of population genetics, evolutionary biology, and conservation genetics, focusing on plants, indigenous livestock, and wildlife in developing countries. I am particularly interested in understanding the genetic basis of population diversity, demographic history, genetic drift, and gene flow effects on evolution, as well as using genetic data to conserve endangered species. Additionally, I am interested in genomic surveillance, antimicrobial resistance, and the One Health approach, utilizing genetic tools to study emerging and re-emerging pathogens affecting livestock, wildlife, and human health.

Beyond my research, I teach and serve as a reviewer for the Journal of Agriculture, Science, and Technology. My teaching career began as a graduate teaching assistant during my Masterâ€™s and Ph.D. studies, and I later became a lecturer responsible for molecular biotechnology classes.
