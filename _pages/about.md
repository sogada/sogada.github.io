I have a broad interest in bioinformatics and evolutionary genetics. During my graduate studies, I concentrated on the population and evolutionary genetics of plants, indigenous livestock, and endangered wildlife. My research focused on understanding the genetic basis of population diversity, demographic history, and the effects of genetic drift and gene flow on evolution.

Stephen Ogada is a Bioinformatician and Evolutionary and Population geneticist with a Ph.D. in Biotechnology from the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya. His research interests lie in the intersection of population genetics, evolutionary biology, and conservation genetics of plants, indigenous livestock, and wildlife in developing countries. He is particularly interested in understanding the genetic basis of population diversity, demographic history, genetic drift, and gene flow effects on evolution and using genetic data to conserve endangered species. Stephen is also interested in genomic surveillance, antimicrobial resistance, and the One Health approach. Using genetic tools to study emerging and re-emerging pathogens that cause livestock, wildlife, and human diseases. In addition to research, Stephen is also a reviewer for the Journal of Agriculture, Science, and Technology.

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
