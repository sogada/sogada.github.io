Driven by a deep passion for data analytics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, my focus lies at the intersection of evolutionary genomics, agricultural production, and One Health. My expertise spans various omics approaches, including transcriptomics and metagenomics, allowing me to tackle complex biological challenges and contribute to transformative advancements.

Beyond the lab, I excel in steering projects and programs toward success by designing and implementing strategies that ensure efficiency, effectiveness, and alignment with overarching goals. My enthusiasm for optimizing workflows and promoting collaborative environments enables me to drive projects to successful completion, ultimately making a tangible impact in scientific research and real-world applications.

As a molecular biologist and bioinformatics specialist in evolutionary and population genetics, I earned my Ph.D. in Biotechnology from Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology in Kenya. Throughout my graduate studies, I focused on the population and evolutionary genetics of indigenous livestock and endangered wildlife. My research examined the genetic basis of population diversity, demographic history, and the impacts of genetic drift and gene flow on evolutionary processes in quails. This work was integral to a broader initiative aimed at developing complementary and sustainable protein sources.

Looking ahead, my passion for population genetics, evolutionary biology, and conservation genetics continues to drive my research. I am particularly interested in applying these insights to plants, indigenous livestock, and wildlife conservation in developing countries. My pursuits include investigating the genetic mechanisms shaping population diversity, demographic histories, and the influences of genetic drift and gene flow on evolution. Furthermore, I am dedicated to leveraging genomic tools to advance genomic surveillance, particularly in studying antimicrobial resistance and adopting a One Health approach. These efforts aim to address emerging and re-emerging pathogens impacting livestock, wildlife, and human health.

Beyond my research, I teach and serve as a reviewer for the Journal of Agriculture, Science, and Technology. My teaching career began as a graduate teaching assistant during my Masterâ€™s and Ph.D. studies, and I later became a lecturer responsible for molecular biotechnology classes at the Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology.
