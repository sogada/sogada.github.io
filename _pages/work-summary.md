Here is a summary of my professional work.

## Current research projects
**Dromedary camel metagenomics:** Microbiome profiling of dromedary camels of Kenya to detect bacteria and viruses that are present.

## Consultancy 
- Bioinformatics analysis and consultation in the genomics of Doum palm project. Publication: [Doum Palm genomics](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/genetics/articles/10.3389/fgene.2022.762202/full)
- Bioinformatics consulting in the RNA-Seq Analysis of Macrophytes in response to Ammonium nitrogen stress project. Publication: [Submerged macrophytes transcriptomics](https://www.mdpi.com/2223-7747/12/22/3875)
- Soil metagenomics project analysis and consultation (*On-going*)

## Past research projects
I have worked on various research projects and programs in different capacities, including as a project coordinator, project manager, data analyst, and research assistant. My specific contributions to each project are detailed in my curriculum vitae. Below is a list of these projects:
- Phenotypic and morphometric differentiation of indigenous chickens from Kenya and other tropical countries augments perspectives for genetic resource improvement and conservation (2016)
- Genetic Evidence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-Cov) and Widespread Seroprevalence among Camels in Kenya (2017).
- Molecular detection of viruses in Kenyan bats and discovery of novel astroviruses, caliciviruses and rotaviruses (2016).
- Genomic and Pathogenic Characteristics of Virulent Newcastle Disease Virus Isolated from Chicken in Live Bird Markets and Backyard Flocks in Kenya (2020).
- Directed Breeding Programs for Improved Poultry Livestock by Genetic Bioinformatics Research and Development (BIRD) in Kenya (2022).

## Workshops
Below is a list of workshops that I played a key role in organizing:
- Genome-Wide Association Studies in Human and Agricultural Biotechnology Workshop (2022). Organized by Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya and Hasselt University, Belgium.
- Introduction to R programming for biologists (2024). Organized by Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya and Hasselt University, Belgium.
